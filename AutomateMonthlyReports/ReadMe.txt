So the documentation is just in a word doc on how to use the program.
This will explain more about how it was MADE. If someone else wants to polish up my code then feel free to do so. 

Everything in this directory is either a shortcut or the documentation. The AutomateReports.exe is in build>exe.win32-3.6
and the XGen-0.1-win32.msi is in the dist folder.


I use CX_Freez to make this exe out of a python 3.6 program. The IDE I used was Spyder. Documentation is in a word doc like 
my boss wanted. Sorry unix boys.
