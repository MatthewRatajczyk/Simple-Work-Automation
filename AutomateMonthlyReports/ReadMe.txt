So the documentation is just in a word doc on how to use the program.
This will explain more about how it was MADE. If someone else wants to polish up my code then feel free to do so. 

Everything in this directory is either a shortcut or the documentation. The AutomateReports.exe is in build>exe.win32-3.6
and the XGen-0.1-win32.msi is in the dist folder.

All of the source code is in the Source Code folder. There are 2 AutomateReports.py programs. I forgot which one was the real one.
I'm  99% SURE its the AutomateReports.py not the AutomateReports1.py. But that AutomateReports1.py was sitting on my desktop
so I though I would inclued it.

I use CX_Freez to make this exe out of a python 3.6 program. The IDE I used was Spyder. Documentation is in a word doc like 
my boss wanted. Sorry unix boys.

Yes that Icon is a really compressed jpg of Nanachi from "made in abyss" good anime would watch. I'll include the source 
pic in the build folder.
